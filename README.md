## Base 

### Description 
This assingment I had to build a base for a caster. The dimensions were 200mm by 120mm and 8mm thick. It has 6 holes which are 10mmwide and 20mm from the edge spaced equally along the edges.

### Reflection 
This project wasn't very difficult. I learned things about Onshape since this was my first time ever using it. I learned shortcuts for the program. It was my first project I had ever done with Onshape and I'm looking forward to more of them. 

## Mount

### Description 
For this assingment I had to make a mount. I used the steps in Canvas to work on the first part but as I kept working I was able to do it without the help of the instructions.
